# CodeSolversTechnicalTest
This is a selenium automated test built for passing the technical assesment for CodeSolvers.

For CodeSolvers team:
Hi dear CodeSolvers team,
This is a C# Project build with Reqnroll framework (which is a reboot/fork of SpecFlow framework which I used a while ago)

If you don't know the framework and are struggling running the project, just need to follow these steps:
-Install a .NET IDE (I used Visual Studio 2022 Comunity, I'm not sure if this framework supports Visual Studio Code).
-Install Reqnroll extension.
-Open the project.

If the project doesn't run after following the above steps, please consult the official Reqnroll documentation:
https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/quickstart/index.html
https://reqnroll.net/about/

Thanks for reading!!!!
